                        <p class="publication-authors">Sarah Chen, Michael Roberts, Kevin Anderson</p>
                        <p class="publication-venue">Journal of Technology Policy Studies, Vol. 47, No. 3 (2025)</p>
                        <p class="publication-abstract">This article examines the challenges of implementing effective accountability mechanisms for AI systems deployed in government settings. Drawing on case studies from federal and state agencies, we propose a multi-layered governance framework that addresses technical, organizational, and legal dimensions of algorithmic accountability. Our framework emphasizes the importance of documentation, audit trails, and human oversight in high-stakes decision-making contexts.</p>

                        <p class="publication-authors">Jennifer Lee, David Park, Tyler Washington</p>
                        <p class="publication-venue">Health Affairs, Vol. 44, No. 2 (2025)</p>
                        <p class="publication-abstract">We analyze emerging privacy-preserving technologies, including differential privacy and secure multi-party computation, in the context of healthcare data sharing. Through interviews with health system administrators and privacy officers, we identify key barriers to adoption and propose policy reforms to facilitate responsible data sharing for research while maintaining patient confidentiality.</p>

                        <p class="publication-authors">Maria Garcia, James Thompson, Nina Kim</p>
                        <p class="publication-venue">Journal of Rural Studies, Vol. 93 (2024)</p>
                        <p class="publication-abstract">This empirical study evaluates the effectiveness of Virginia's rural broadband expansion programs from 2020-2024. Using a mixed-methods approach combining survey data, economic analysis, and qualitative interviews, we find that while infrastructure deployment has improved, adoption barriers related to affordability and digital literacy remain significant. We offer evidence-based recommendations for improving program design.</p>

                        <p class="publication-venue">Information, Communication & Society, Vol. 28, No. 1 (2024)</p>
                        <p class="publication-abstract">We present a comparative analysis of content moderation policies and practices across major social media platforms, examining how platform governance structures, transparency mechanisms, and appeals processes vary. Our research reveals significant differences in approaches to harmful content and highlights implications for regulatory policy, particularly regarding platform accountability and user rights.</p>

                        <p class="publication-venue">Law and Society Review, Vol. 58, No. 4 (2024)</p>
                        <p class="publication-abstract">This study examines the use of algorithmic risk assessment tools in pre-trial detention and sentencing decisions across multiple jurisdictions. Through technical audits and analysis of case outcomes, we document patterns of disparate impact across demographic groups and evaluate the effectiveness of existing fairness mitigation strategies. We argue that technical solutions alone are insufficient and must be paired with robust procedural safeguards and human oversight.</p>
