## Changes Made

### Priority 1: Image Optimization

**Issue:** Large image files slowing down site load times
- `tech-pr-policy-decisions.png` = 993KB (needs compression)
- `bat_rgb_ko.png` = 375KB (needs compression)

**Action Needed (Manual):**
Cannot be automated - requires image editing software:
1. Open `tech-pr-policy-decisions.png` in image editor
2. Export as WebP format OR compress PNG to under 200KB
3. Open `bat_rgb_ko.png` in image editor
4. Compress to under 50KB or find SVG version from UVA

**Tools to use:**
- TinyPNG.com (online compression)
- Squoosh.app (Google's image optimizer)
- Photoshop/GIMP export settings

**Status:** DOCUMENTED - Requires manual action
